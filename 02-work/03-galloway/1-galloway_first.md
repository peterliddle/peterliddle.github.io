title: Galloway Coast 72-74
order: 1

text: In parallel with his work in the Lakeland Hills, Peter explored the adjacent Scottish Coast.  The Galloway series builds upon his vibrant Cornish 'Wave Series'.  However, the new paintings are much heavier in tone and more mysterious than their predecessors.  Shadowy figures and anatomical parts emerge as if from the recesses of the sub-conscious.
