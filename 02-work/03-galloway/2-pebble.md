title: Pebble Series 77-79
order: 2

text: In 1977 Peter began a series that marked a break with some of his earlier coastal scenes; collectively they are referred to as the 'Pebble Series'.  They began and largely remained more naturalistic than his earlier work.  However, they are certainly not photographic or any less inventive compositionally.  Hundreds, probably thousands, of painstakingly rendered, Seurat like, coloured pebbles, and sometimes large erratic rocks, form the content and the vessel for Peter's sublime, heady vision of the natural world.
