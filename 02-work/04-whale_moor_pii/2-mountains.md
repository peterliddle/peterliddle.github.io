text: In all of Peter's paintings we are never a passive viewer and are pushed to inhabit the scene in some sense.  In earlier paintings, this may be simply the eye being led around the canvas by his use of complementary colours and construction.  However in this series we are projected forcibly through the landscape, as if on a zip-wire or in flight, so clear and imperative is the path ahead.
