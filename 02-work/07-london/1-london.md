text: Peter has a great love for London, having lived there during his early career.  He always returns to the Thames, the constantly changing but ever present artery of the city and its connection to the wild world beyond.  The 'Chatham Kent Express' is Peter's best allegorical painting, the Daily Express building, transposed to the semi-demolished Old Blackfriars Bridge, as if it were about to de-rail itself.
