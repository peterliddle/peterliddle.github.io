title: Cornwall 69, Wave
order: 2

text: |
  In 1969 Peter began a series of paintings with a similar wave motif. They were much more controlled, ordered and simplified than his earlier work.  Although he only painted in this style for less than a year, the formality and break from the free form abstraction mark the beginning of a more mature style.
