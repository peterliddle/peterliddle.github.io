  In 1966, Peter moved to Portholland, Cornwall.  During this period Peter's style changed completely.  He credits the challenge of the incredible Portholland light in his transition from heavy, textured, oils to whiter, more transparent, acrylics.  His work was regularly exhibited with both the Newlyn and Penwith Societies of Art.
