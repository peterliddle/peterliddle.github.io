title: Sculpture in Stone
order: 2

text: Perhaps to an even greater extent than when sculpting with wood, Peter seeks to sculpt with stone found during his adventures.  Jasper from the dangerous rocky coves of the Llyn Peninsula, Carrara Marble from the Hills of Tuscany and even stone from a river running through the parkland surrounding his studio.
