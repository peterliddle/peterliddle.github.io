text: Peter moved permanently to the Lake District in November 1971, just over thirty years after he first climbed Helvellyn, at the age of eight, with his uncle.  He first directed his attention towards the other principal mountain of the Northern Lakes, Blencathra, which now dominated the view from his bathroom window, painting several images with horizontal banding, similar to his recent 'Wave Series'.
