title: Development of sculptural form 74-76
order: 2

text: After several years among the mountains Peter began to respond increasingly to rock and  water in a more elemental way - giving material sculpted depth in place of abstract bands and fields.  This development of style can be read as an amalgamation of his pre and post Cornish 'Wave Series' abstractions in acrylic.
