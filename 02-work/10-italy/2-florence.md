  Peter was invited to take a group of Ullswater Community College students and teachers to Florence in 1996.  It was a great opportunity for him to see the work of many of his favourite painters, sculptors and architects.  He would return two or three times to paint a series of paintings based on the route of Fra Angelico's daily journey through the city - from San Domenico to San Marco, up Via Vecchia Fiesolana.
