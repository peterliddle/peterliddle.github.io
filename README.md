# peterliddle.com
Site for Artist Peter Liddle (Static with Jekyll)

All content generated automatically at Jekyll build excluding the main navigation.

I have been unable to create the rather complex data I need to create the stacked navigation on the fly.  Instead a csv file is created at build time and must be moved manually from \_site.csv to \_data.csv to update the navigation following a change to page titles and hierarchy.  I'm sure this could be achieved using a plugin but then it won't work in github pages.
